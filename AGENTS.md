# Nest.js Component Testing Course

## About This Project

This project contains comprehensive course materials for learning **Component Testing in Nest.js**. It's designed to bridge the gap between unit tests and integration tests, focusing on component-level testing strategies for modern Node.js applications built with Nest.js.

## Project Structure

### `/presentations`
Contains presentation slides built with [Reveal.js](https://revealjs.com/). These HTML files deliver the course lectures covering testing theory, best practices, and hands-on demonstrations.

### `/code`
Contains practical code examples and exercises.

#### `/code/examples`
Real-world examples demonstrating component testing patterns and techniques covered in the course. These examples show:
- How to structure component tests
- Testing controllers, services, and modules
- Mocking external dependencies
- Working with databases and message queues in tests
- API mocking with MSW (Mock Service Worker)
- Using Testcontainers for Node.js

#### `/code/exercises`
Exercises for students to practice component testing. Each exercise builds on concepts from the presentations and examples.
